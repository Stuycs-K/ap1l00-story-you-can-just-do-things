Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no artichokes 
in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on the Ringstrasse esplanade, I thought I would <REPLACE_THIS_VERB> about 
a little and see the <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE> part of the historic center of Vienna. It is a way I have of driving off the 
epilepsy and regulating circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the Artichoke Convention; 
whenever it is a <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE>, <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE> November in my nightmares; whenever I find myself involuntarily 
<REPLACE_THIS_VERB> before coffin makers, and bringing up the rear of every wedding party I meet; and 
especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE> 
moral principle to prevent me from deliberately <REPLACE_THIS_VERB> into the Kunsthistoriches Museum, and methodically 
<REPLACE_THIS_VERB> people's hats off—then, I account it high time to get to a Deutschen  street sign as soon as I can. 
There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all undertakers in their degree, 
some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the street signs of Vienna with me.
