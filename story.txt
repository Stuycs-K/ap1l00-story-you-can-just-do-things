Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no artichokes 
in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on the Ringstrasse esplanade, I thought I would waddle about 
a little and see the less tourist-infested part of the historic center of Vienna. It is a way I have of driving off the 
epilepsy and regulating circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the Artichoke Convention; 
whenever it is a frenzied, luminous November in my nightmares; whenever I find myself involuntarily 
curtsying before coffin makers, and bringing up the rear of every wedding party I meet; and 
especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a motionless 
moral principle to prevent me from deliberately goose-stepping into the Kunsthistoriches Museum, and methodically 
knocking people's hats off—then, I account it high time to get to a proper street sign as soon as I can. 
There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all ducks in their degree, 
some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the street signs of Vienna with me.


Time to practice creative writing: Whenever I find myself frequently appending 'sir' to my sentences; 
whenever all my dreams end with a child seated in my lap; whenever the split ends in my hair abruptly begin 
to proliferate dizzyingly; and especially whenever the pollen allergies are so severe, that I must have 
a Kleenex package on hand every day to entirely use it, and so expend eventually significant
quantities of money on tissues - then, I account it high time to attend both my churches
and watch the third's recording at home afterwards. 
There is nothing surprising in this.
